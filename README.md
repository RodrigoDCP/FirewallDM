# FirewallDM
FirewallDM or FWD-M is a tool designed to simplify the use of another tool called "Firewalld" on Ubuntu servers. Firewalld is a dynamic firewall for Linux systems that provides a set of tools to manage network traffic.

FirewallDM is a console/terminal-based "graphical user interface" for Firewalld that allows inexperienced users to easily manage firewall configuration. The program can be installed on Ubuntu systems via the command line using the "apt-get" package manager.

It is important to note that to use FirewallDM, some prerequisites need to be installed on the server, such as Python3, Pip, Colorama, and others that may not be available by default on your system.

Once installed, FirewallDM provides several options for managing the Firewalld tool, such as the ability to add services and ports, as well as update and monitor firewall configuration. Additionally, the program also provides useful information on the current state of the firewall and applied rules on the system.

In summary, FirewallDM is a useful tool for those who want to manage Firewalld configuration on Ubuntu servers in an easy and efficient way. With its intuitive graphical user interface and multiple management options, this program is an excellent choice for users who have no experience in administering firewalls on Linux systems.
